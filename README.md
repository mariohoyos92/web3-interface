# Interface for Django backend to interface with crowdsale contract



## Installation
- npm install

## Running the app
 - node index.js

## Notes
 - To override the web3 provider or the addresses of the contract/contract owner, add a .env file at the root directory or pass in the corresponding environment variables. Otherwise, the development defaults point to a deterministic ganache instance running on the azure VM
